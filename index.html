  <p>Although repelling may seem scary at first, many first-timers catch on very quickly. Even at heights of several hundred feet, first time repellers can quickly gain confidence and repel with the pros. This is a photo of my wife and I repelling into the famous Waitomo Caves in the north island of New Zealand. After a 300 foot repel into the depths of the cave, the group trekked upstream in the river below for 6 hours until daylight was visible out of the other side. The tour came with wet suits, dinner at the end, and the friendliest guides you could ask for. I highly recommend this amazing repel and cave adventure to anyone interested.</p>
